## String

A string in C is essentially **an array of characters**, and an ***array*** can be thought of as a pointer to **its first element**. 

When we do operations like s `+= 2`, we're advancing the pointer `s` so that it **points to a new location**, effectively skipping certain characters in the stringâ€”in this case, the `0x` or `0X`.

If you're not familiar with pointers, you can think of `s` as an ***`index`*** into the **array of characters** that **make up the string**. When the ***function*** starts, `s` is at the **first** character of the string. After `s += 2`, `s` would be at the **third** character, **bypassing the first two characters**.

```c
int index = 0;
if (s[index] == '0' && tolower(s[index + 1]) == 'x') {
    index += 2; // Skip the "0x" or "0X" prefix if it's there.
}
```
